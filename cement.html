    <h1> How to make cement </h1>
    <p>Cement is manufactured by heating a precise mixture of finely ground limestone, clay and sand in a rotating kiln to temperatures reaching 1450ÂºC. This results in the production of cement clinker, an intermediate product in the manufacture of cement.</p>
    
    <h2> The history of cement </h2>
    <p> Cement as we know it was first developed by Joseph Aspdin, an enterprising 19th-century British stonemason, who heated a mix of ground limestone and clay in his kitchen stove, then pulverized the concoction into a fine powder. The result was the world's first hydraulic cement: one that hardens when water is added.</p>

    <h1>How are they made</h1>

    <p>Sheets of cellulose fiber are soaked in chemicals to render them pliable and soft. The sheets, hemp fiber and sodium sulphate crystals, are then placed in large rotating containers to blend the ingredients. ... The pores or gaps left from the melted crystals form the familiar structure we see in finished sponges.</p>
      
      <h2> History of sponges</h2>
    
    <p>Sponges were invented in 1937 by a German scientist who accidentally discovered polyurethane foam, the polymer that constitutes most of these cleaning pads.</p>
